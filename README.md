# Password Generator
This is a password generator made in python.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to create strong passwords that you will be able to remember easily.

## How it Works
Type in a word or phrase and input the amount of times you want to generate a password. It will output a number of different individual passwords. Each one is unique in how different symbols, numbers, capital/lower case letters are spread out. Even so you would still be able to recognize that it is the word or phrase you originally inputted.

After the passwords have been generated pick whichever one you want. (Recomend that you test that it is a strong pasword).
